OpenSees - Release 1
This is the first release of the OpenSees framework. Feedback and
comments would be greatly appreciated.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

UNIX: You need to create a Makefile.def for your system. We have no automatic
configuration at this time. You should copy one of existing Makefile.def.* in 
the directory MAKES to this directory and rename it Makefile.def. Then 
typically all you need to do is modify the $HOME variable. You also need a 
bin and lib directory in $HOME. Then type 'make'.

Note: Depending on your system you may need to install some additional 
packages, i.e. tcl/tk and mysql.

WINDOWS: go the Win32 and open up the vc++ project. then do a build once loaded.
Note: You do need to have installed tcl/tk.


FRAMEWORK CONTENTS:

This directory contains the following:
	COPYRIGHT a file containing the copyright information on the
	code that has so far been developed.

	SRC the source code for all the classes developed for OpenSees can
	be found in this subdirectory.

	Makefile this is a makefile that may be provided to the unix 
        make program. It will create the libraries specified by YOU the
	user in Makefile.def. NOTE TO RUN PROPERLY YOU NEED TO HAVE
	PREINSTALLED THE TCL/TK LIBRARIES AND INCLUDE FILES. These 
	can be found at http://dev.scriptics.com/software/tcltk.
	If you are running LINUX you probably already have the files.
	NOTE THAT BEFORE YOU RUN 'make', YOU NEED TO HAVE CREATED THE 
	DIRECTORIES '$(HOME)/lib' and '$(HOME)/bin' where $(HOME) is
	what you have defined in Makefile.def.

	Makefile.def this is the one file you must edit. You need to
	set paths, library names, your favorite compiler and compiler 
	options.

	DOCUMENTS is a subdirectory containing 3 postscript files.

		LAPACK - contains the lapack routines called.	
		ARPACK- containts the ARPACK routines called.
