AMD License: At the user's option, you may use AMD under either the LGPL

licenses, nor may you mix-and-match clauses from each license.  To use a
license, in the documentation for your application simply state either of the
following, replacing <YOUR APPLICATION> with the name of your application:

    AMD, Copyright (c), 1996-2015, Timothy A. Davis,
    Patrick R. Amestoy, and Iain S. Duff.  All Rights Reserved.
    Used in <YOUR APPLICATION> under the BSD 3-clause license.

or

    AMD, Copyright (c), 1996-2015, Timothy A. Davis,
    Patrick R. Amestoy, and Iain S. Duff.  All Rights Reserved.
    Used in <YOUR APPLICATION> under the LGPL v2.1 license.

In the event that your package <A> includes another package <B> by another
author, and <A> and <B> use AMD under different licenses, you may select
one license to apply to both uses of AMD in the combined application.
