The  TLFD20nBrick element is the the three dimensional element implemented based
on  the  tensor  operation.  The  argument to construct the element are its tag,
\texttt{TLFD20nBrick},  element  tag,  \texttt{eleTag},  ordered  twenty  nodes,
\texttt{nd01} to \texttt{nd20}, and the body forces, \texttt{bf1}, \texttt{bf2},
\texttt{bf3}. By default, $3 \times 3 \times 3$ integration points are used. The
valid material tags for this element are hyperelastic material (see Tcl Commands
for  Hyperelastic  Material  Models)  and  hyperelasto-plastic material (see Tcl
Commands for Hyperelasto-Plastic Material Models).
