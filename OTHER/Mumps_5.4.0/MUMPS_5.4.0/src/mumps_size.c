    With the form "*addr=(MUMPS_INT8)a", "(MUMPS_INT8)a"

    for large addresses. In the above code, "(MUMPS_INT8*)&a"
    is a pointer to the address "a", considering that "a" is
    a MUMPS_INT8 rather than an address. Then the content of
    that pointer is the exact binary representation of the
    address a, but stored in a MUMPS_INT8 (signed 64-bit
    integer).
