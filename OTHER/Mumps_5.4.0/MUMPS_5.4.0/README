===========================================
MUMPS 5.4.0
===========================================

MUMPS 5.4.0 solves a sparse system of linear equations A x = b
using Gaussian elimination. Please read this README file and
the documentation (in ./doc/) for a complete list of
functionalities. Documentation and publications related
to MUMPS can also be found at http://mumps-solver.org/

For installation problems, bug reports, and to report your
experience/feedback with the package, please subscribe to the
MUMPS Users's mailing list.

Please refer to INSTALL for installation instructions.

Please refer to LICENSE for conditions of use the package.


Contents of the distribution:
----------------------------

ChangeLog  LICENSE    CREDITS    INSTALL    README     VERSION
Makefile   Make.inc/  doc/       src/       lib/       include/
libseq/    examples/  PORD/      MATLAB/    SCILAB/

doc      contains the users' guide in pdf format.

src      contains the source files (for all arithmetics 's','d','c' or 'z')
         necessary to generate the MUMPS library.

lib      is the place where the MUMPS libraries libxmumps.a
         (x='s','d','c' or 'z') and the arith-independent
         library libmumps_common.a are generated.

include  contains xmumps_struc.h, xmumps_root.h and xmumps_c.h (where x is one
         of 'd','c','s','z' depending on the arithmetic desired),
         mumps_c_types.h and mumps_compat.h. The first two files must be
         available at compile time in order to use MUMPS from external FORTRAN
         programs. The three others for C programs.

libseq   contains a sequential MPI library used by the purely sequential
         version of MUMPS.

examples contains illustrative test programs showing how MUMPS can be used.

PORD     contains the PORD package (not part of MUMPS) from University
         of Paderborn. See PORD/README for more info.

MATLAB   contains a MATLAB interface to the sequential version of MUMPS

SCILAB   contains a SCILAB interface to the sequential version of MUMPS
         (only tested with scilab version 4)
