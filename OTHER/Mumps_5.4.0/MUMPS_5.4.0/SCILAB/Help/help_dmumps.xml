  <PARAM target="in">

  <PARAM_NAME>mat</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
: sparse matrix which has to be provided as the second argument of
      dmumps if id.JOB is strictly larger than 0.
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>id.SYM</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
: controls the matrix type (symmetric positive 
    definite, symmetric indefinite or unsymmetric) and it has do be 
    initialized by the user before the initialization phase of MUMPS 
    (see id.JOB). Its value is set to 0 after the call of initmumps.
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>id.JOB</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
: defines the action that will be realized by
      MUMPS: initialize, analyze and/or factorize and/or solve and 
      release MUMPS internal C/Fortran data. It has to be set by the user before 
      any call to MUMPS (except after a call to initmumps,  which sets
      its value to -1).
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM>	
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>id.ICNTL and id.CNTL</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
: define control parameters that can be
      set after the initialization call (id.JOB = -1). See Section ``Control parameters''
of the MUMPS user's guide
      for more details.
      If the user does not modify an entry in id.ICNTL then MUMPS 
      uses the default parameter. For example, if the user wants to 
      use the AMD ordering, he/she should set id.ICNTL(7) = 0.
      Note that the following 
      parameters are inhibited because they are automatically set 
      within the interface: id.ICNTL(19) which controls the Schur 
      complement option and id.ICNTL(20) which controls the 
      format of the right-hand side.
      Note that parameters id.ICNTL(1:4) may not work properly
      depending on your compiler and your environment. In case of
      problem, we recommand to swith printing off by setting
      id.ICNL(1:4)=-1.
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM>	
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>id.PERM_IN</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
: corresponds to the given ordering option 
      (see Section ``Input and output parameters''
of the MUMPS user's guide
for more details). Note that this permutation is only accessed if
the parameter id.ICNTL(7) is set to 1.
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM> 
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>id.COLSCA and id.ROWSCA</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
: are optional scaling arrays (see Section 
``Input and output parameters''
of the MUMPS user's guide
for more details)
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM> 
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>id.RHS</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
: defines the right-hand side. The parameter id.ICNTL(20) related to its format (sparse or dense) is automatically set within the interface. Note that id.RHS is not modified (as in MUMPS), the solution is returned in id.SOL.
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM> 
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>id.VAR_SCHUR</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
: corresponds to the list of variables 
      that appear in the Schur complement matrix (see Section 
``Input and output parameters''
of the MUMPS user's guide
for more details).
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM> 
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>id.REDRHS</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
(input parameter only if id.VAR_SCHUR was provided during the factorization and
if ICNTL(26)=2 on entry to the solve phase): partial
solution on the variables corresponding to the Schur complement. It is provided
by the user and normally results from both the Schur complement and the reduced right-hand
side that were returned by MUMPS in a previous call. When ICNTL(26)=2, MUMPS uses this information
to build the solution id.SOL on the complete problem.
See Section ``Schur complement''
of the MUMPS user's guide
for more details.
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM> 
  </PARAM_INDENT>
  </PARAM>
  <PARAM target="out">
  <PARAM_INDENT>
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>id.SCHUR</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
: if id.VAR_SCHUR is provided of size SIZE_SCHUR, then
id.SCHUR corresponds to a dense array of size 
      (SIZE_SCHUR,SIZE_SCHUR) that holds the Schur 
      complement matrix (see Section 
``Input and output parameters''
of the MUMPS user's guide
for more details). The user does not have to initialize it. 
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>id.REDRHS</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
(output parameter only if ICNTL(26)=1 and id.VAR_SCHUR was defined): Reduced right-hand side (or
condensed right-hand side on the variables associated to the Schur complement). It
is computed by MUMPS during the solve stage if ICNTL(26)=1. It can then be used
outside MUMPS, together with the Schur complement, to build a solution on the interface.
See Section ``Schur complement''
of the MUMPS user's guide
for more details.
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM> 
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>id.INFOG and id.RINFOG</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
: information parameters
      (see Section ``Information parameters''
of the MUMPS user's guide
).
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM> 
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>id.SYM_PERM</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
: corresponds to a symmetric permutation 
      of the variables
      (see discussion regarding ICNTL(7) in Section 
``Control parameters''
of the MUMPS user's guide
).  This permutation is computed during the analysis and is
followed by the numerical factorization except when numerical
pivoting occurs. 
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM> 
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>id.UNS_PERM</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
: column permutation (if any) on exit from the analysis
      phase of MUMPS
      (see discussion regarding ICNTL(6) in Section 
``Control parameters''
of the MUMPS user's guide
).
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_ITEM>
  <PARAM_NAME>id.SOL</PARAM_NAME>
<PARAM_DESCRIPTION>
: dense vector or matrix containing the solution after MUMPS 
      solution phase. Also contains the nullspace in case of
null space computation, or entries of the inverse, in case of
computation of inverse entries.
  </PARAM_DESCRIPTION> 
  </PARAM_ITEM>

  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
    The function dmumps solves systems of
    linear equations of the form Ax = b where A is square sparse matrix and b
    is a dense or sparse vector or matrix. The solver MUMPS is used and
    we refer the user to the MUMPS User's Guide for full details.
    Before the first call to dmumps, a call to initmumps must have been done:
