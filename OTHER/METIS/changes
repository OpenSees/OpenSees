METIS 2.0 contains a number of changes over METIS 1.0.
The major changes are the following:

- A new faster k-way partitioning algorithm has been implemented
  that produces good partitions for moderately large k (k>10), and
  it is up to 5 times faster the previous recursive bisection
  algorithm used in version 1.0.

- The algorithms have been extended to handle non-power of 2 partitions.  

- A stand-alone library is provided to directly use the partitioning
  and ordering algorithms in METIS.

- A number of modifications to the existing matching schemes have been
  incorporated to better handle weighted graphs.

- Some speed improvements over 1.0, up to 15\% faster in some cases.

- Added code to check the validity of the input graph. This tends to
  increase the time required during I/O. Validity checking is turned
  off in the stand-alone library.

- Better memory management. Hopefully this should solve memory problems.
