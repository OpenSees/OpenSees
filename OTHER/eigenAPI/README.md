This folder contains header-only sources meant to interface OpenSees with eigen in an effective way. 
We define macros for vectors, matrices and tensors, as well as implementations of common operations
that are useful for implementing new elements and materials. 

Eigen can be obtained automatically using the conan-based build or must be independently in the case of makefiles or Visual Studio.
