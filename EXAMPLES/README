The example subdirectories include:

        Example1:  contains a main() C++ routine which creates and
	    performs the analysis of the example1 problem outlined
	    in 'Adding an Element to G3'

                main.C - example C++ main driver (could be simpler)


               typing 'make' builds the executable example1
               typing 'make wipe' removes example1 and .o files

	ExampleScripts:  contains TCL scripts which define and analyze
	    R/C frames. to run these examples enter the interpreter
            and source in these files with the command:
		              source <fileName>

		RCFrame1.tcl - pushover analysis
		RCFrame2.tcl - pushover analysis with a simple
			TCL procedure that performs the analysis
		RCFrame3.tcl - linear elastic analysis
		RCFrame4.tcl - linear and nonlinear EQ analysis
		RCFrame5.tcl - pushover analysis with frame defined
			using a node and element generating TCL
			procedure
                RCFrameDisplay.tcl - commands for opening a window
	                used to display the RCFrame1-5 examples
	        RigidFrame3D.tcl - a nonlinear EQ analysis of a 3d fframe
                        with elastic columns and nonlinear beams with rigid 
                        diaphragm constraints
		genPlaneFrame.tcl - defines node and element generating
			TCL procedure


        PlaneFrame:  contains a main() C++ routine which uses
		the PlaneFrame model builder and performs a linear
	        static analysis.

                main.C - example C++ main driver (could be simpler)
	        quick.in - an example PlaneFrame input file.

               typing 'make' builds the executable PlaneFrame
               typing 'make wipe' removes PlaneFrame and .o files


        TclModelBuilder: contains the files outlined in the document
		'Adding an Element to g3'. 

                myG3 - an executable.
                myCommands.C - contains procedure for adding new commands to g3
                TclPlaneTruss.h/.C - an example of a tcl model builder
                MyTruss.h/.C - files to add the new truss member
		example1.tcl, example2.tcl - the two tcl scripts
		     presented in the cocument 'Adding an Element to g3'

		examples - a dircetory containg some more scripts

                to load a script in the running interpreter type
                    source testX.tcl
                
                typing 'make' builds the executable myG3
                typing 'make wipe' remove myG3 and .o files
