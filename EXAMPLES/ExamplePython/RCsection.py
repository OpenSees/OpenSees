# Formal arguments
#    id - tag for the section that is generated by this procedure
#    h - overall height of the section (see above)
#    b - overall width of the section (see above)
#    cover - thickness of the cover patches
#    coreID - material tag for the core patch
#    coverID - material tag for the cover patches
#    steelID - material tag for the reinforcing steel
#    numBars - number of reinforcing bars on any given side of the section
#    barArea - cross-sectional area of each reinforcing bar
#    nfCoreY - number of fibers in the core patch in the y direction
#    nfCoreZ - number of fibers in the core patch in the z direction
#    nfCoverY - number of fibers in the cover patches with long sides in the y direction
#    nfCoverZ - number of fibers in the cover patches with long sides in the z direction
#
# Notes
#    The thickness of cover concrete is constant on all sides of the core.
#    The number of bars is the same on any given side of the section.
#    The reinforcing bars are all the same size.
#    The number of fibers in the short direction of the cover patches is set to 1.
