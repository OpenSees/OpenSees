The examples in this directory can be run interactivily or or as batch jobs.

1) for running jobs interactivily you need to login to dspoe.sdsc.edu and submit
   the job from the command line using the poe command. FOr example to run Example1.tcl
   on a single machine using 2 nodes you would type (replacing the path to OpenSees):

     poe /gpfs/fmk/bin/OpenSees Example1.tcl -nodes 1 -tasks_per_node m

2) for batch processing of a job you need to login to dslogin.sdsc.edu and you need
   to submit your job from the command line using llsubmit and the submit files provided. 
   For example to run Example1.tcl you need to:
     a)  edit submit1 (replacing the path to OpenSees and the location of the DatastarExamples directory).
     b)  at the command line prompt type: 

      llsubmit submit1

for further infomation of how to run files on datastar, i suggest you read the on-line documentation.
