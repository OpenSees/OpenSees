This is in progress. 

To test on unix, run make in this directory and then run OpenSees and source 
in example2.tcl to see new user defined element. NOTE you may have to modify 
your current Makefile.def, see changes to those in /MAKES.

Contents:
   example1.tcl - example script that runs with existing OpenSees interpreter
   example2.tcl - example that uses the new user defined element
   MyTruss.h/.cpp - new user defined element
   TclMyTruss.cpp - procedure called when 'element myTruss ...' is found.
   Makefile     - Makefile to build the shared library on unix machine 

NOTE TO FMK. going to have to work on changing auto_path in the interpreter
to include the current directory. also may have to change 'load' command
to be 'package' as there is a conflict and i am overwriting tcl load command
which is needed to run example2.tcl & also needed if use the package require 
option. To run under bash with LD_LIBRARY_PATH not set up to include the current directory:  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH  OpenSees example1.tcl
