.SH NAME
\fBMPI_T_finalize \fP \- Finalize the MPI tool information interface

.SH SYNTAX
.ft R
.SH C Syntax
.nf
#include <mpi.h>
int MPI_T_finalize(void)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.ft R
MPI_T_finalize() finalizes the MPI tool information interface and must be called the same
number of times as MPI_T_init_thread() by the end of execution. Calls to MPI tool functions
are allowed at any point in execution as long as MPI_T_init_thread() has been called at least
once and the number of calls to MPI_T_init_thread() is greater than the number of calls to
MPI_T_finalize(). If at any point in execution the number of calls to MPI_T_finalize() equals
the number of calls to MPI_T_init_thread() the MPI tool interface will no longer be available
until another call to MPI_T_init_thread().

.SH NOTES
.ft R
Before the end of execution the number of calls to MPI_T_init_thread() and MPI_T_finalize must
be the same.

.SH ERRORS
.ft R
MPI_T_finalize() will fail if:
.TP 1i
[MPI_T_ERR_NOT_INITIALIZED]
The MPI Tools interface not initialized
