# Note that -lopen-pal and all the EXTRA_LIBS are only necessary when
# static linking (they're pulled in by libopen-rte.so's implicit
# dependencies), so only list these in Libs.private.

Libs: -L${libdir}    -lopen-rte
Libs.private: -lopen-pal -lm

# It is safe to hard-wire the -I before the EXTRA_INCLUDES because we
# will not be installing this .pc file unless --enable-devel-headers is
# selected, meaning that there will definitely be a value in EXTRA_INCLUDES.

Cflags: -I${includedir}
